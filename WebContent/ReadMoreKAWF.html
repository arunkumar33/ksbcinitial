<b>Karnataka Advocates Welfare Fund</b> <br>
<u>(Act 2 of 1985 as amended on 6.8.2010) </u> <br>
       The Bar Council has formulated the Welfare Fund Scheme in order to provide social security to the legal profession by providing for payment of lumpsum amount after cessation of practice by its member and also for payment to the dependents of its Members,  if they were to die during their  practice.   </p>
     </article>
<article>
<p> 
         The Advocates Welfare Fund is constituted out of among other emolument, fees and voluntary contribution and grant from Government.  The Bar Council has also introduced the Welfare Fund Stamps so as to generate revenue to the Fund.  The advocates across the State at present are affixing Rs. 10/- on vakalath in all Courts and Rs. 5/- on IAs.  
         During the commencement of the scheme we were paying meager financial benefit to the families of the deceased Advocates and also who are retiring from the practice.  The scheme has been amended and renewed from time to time looking into the growth of the corpus,  income generated from the corpus and resource generated from the sale of stamps.
