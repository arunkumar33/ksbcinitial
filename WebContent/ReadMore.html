<div align="center"><b><u>HISTORY OF LEGAL PROFESSION</u></b></div>
<p>In 1861, British Parliament has passed the Indian High courts Act to establish High Courts in India by Letter Patent.  This is empowered and authorized the High Courts to make Rules for enrolment of advocates,  legal practitioners and attorneys.   In 1865,  the High Courts have formulated the Rules for clarification for admission to the Bar of Advocates, Vakils and Attorney.</p>
<p>Further they have also given power to suspend or remove any of the advocates found guilty of professional misconduct.  Under the said Act,  three High courts were established in three Presidency Towns of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras and they have been vested with the power of  Letter Patent. Subsequently some more High Courts were established in Allahabad, Patna, Lahore and Nagpur. </p>
<p>Clause IX of Letters Patent of High Court of Bengal, Bombay and Madras is as hereunder :</p>
<p align="center"> “To approve, admit and enroll so many advocates, vakils and attorneys as to the said High court shall seem meet and such advocates,  vakils and attorneys shall be and are hereby authorized to appear for the suitors of the said High court,  and to plead or to act or to plead and act, for the said suitors,  according as the said High Court may be its rules and directions determine any subject to such rules and directions”.</p>

<p>
	         As per the said Rules the legal profession originated which became the part and parcel of Indian Judicial System.  In 1879,  the law relating to Legal Practitioners has been enumerated in the Legal Practitioners Act.  Thereafter the Bombay Pleaders Act, 1920 and Indian Bar Councils Act, 1926 came into force to regulate the legal profession in India.
</p>

<p>All Indian Bar Committee has been constituted in the year 1953 so as to give its recommendation in order to streamline the legal profession in India.  Simultaneously the Law Commission has also suggested the reform in the administration of justice along with the said All India Bar Committee. </p>

<p>On the said recommendations, a Bill was drafted in the year 1959 which was ultimately passed by both the Houses of the Parliament and introduced the Advocates Act, 1961.   The said enactment is a complete one giving autonomy to the Bar so as to create a unified All India Bar.  Under this Act,  the State Bar Councils were constituted for each State and one All India Bar Council,  the apex supervisory body of the Bar.  Thus State Bar Councils and the Bar Council of India originated through the Advocates Act, 1961.</p>
