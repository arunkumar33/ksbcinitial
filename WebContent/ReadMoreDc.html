<h2><i>About DC Committiy</i></h2>
<b><u>Discipline of Advocates</u></b><br> <br>
      An advocate shall obey and follow the standards of professional conduct and etiquette rules framed by the Bar Council of India under Sec. 49 (1) ( c) of the Advocates Act, 1961 (See the Rules mentioned in Chapter II of the Bar Council of India Rules). <br>
      An Advocate shall, at all times,  comfort himself in a manner befitting his status as an officer of the Court,  a privileged member of the community,  and a gentleman, bearing in mind that what may be lawful and moral for a person who is not a member of the Bar,  or for a member of the Bar in his non professional capacity may still be improper for an Advocate.  Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing obligation,  an advocate shall fearlessly uphold the interest of his client,  and in his conduct conform to the rules hereinafter mentioned both in letter and in spirit. <br> The rules hereinafter mentioned contain canons of conduct and etiquette adopted as general guides, yet the specific mention thereof shall not be construed as a denial of the existence of others equally imperative though not specifically mentioned.
